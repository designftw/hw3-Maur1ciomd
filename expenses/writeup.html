	<title>Differences between spreadsheet-like app and newer app</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
	Not really sure if this is needed since it is not in the deliverables, but I will do it anyway.  <br>
	The main difference between the spreadsheet-like app and the newer app is that the newer app is more learnable.  <br>
	and has improved usability. On google sheets theres a lot of saftey issues and bugs that can happen becuase <br>
	you have the option to change everything. The app is extremely simple and designed for specifically what they need. <br>
	There's an input table that has the small set of possible options that they want for their expenses. <br>
	Additionally there is a delete button that allows them to delete any expenses that they want which is clear to a user. <br>
	On google sheets you have to know how google sheets works in order to delete a row quickly. If you don't <br>
	it could take a user way longer to delete a row. <br> The newer app is also more efficient becuase all of the expenses <br>
	automatically sort for the user. This is another feature that one would need to know how to do on google sheets. <br>
